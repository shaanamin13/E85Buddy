# E85Buddy
An iOS and Android App to help you calculate your target ethanol content for your vehicle.

Tech Stack:
  Written with the MVVMCross Framework in Xamarin using C#. I add the main functionality/calculations to a .NET core project and then create my views for iOS and Android App. 

Purpose:
  Currently I am running an E30 tune on my Subaru WRX. I figured I should make an app to help me keep track of how much ethanol/gas I should be putting in based on the current fuel tank. There are apps that exist, however I needed to add more stuff to my github to showcase I can make cross platform apps :-). I will check with my car club to see their thoughts on how this app could improve and what features would benefit them.
